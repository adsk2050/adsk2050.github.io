                <h4>Favorite project</h4>
                <h3>IITG Mechanical department website</h3>
                <div class="black-box">
                    <p>Me and my friend and bachelor thesis project partner <a href="#dhiraj">Dhiraj</a> built this <a href="https://iitg.ac.in/mech" target="_blank">awesome website</a> for the Mechanical department of <a href="https://iitg.ac.in" target="_blank">IIT Guwahati</a>, my alma mater.</p>
                    <p>It started as a summer project in May 2019. I mainly worked on the backend and Dhiraj made sure it looked nice. It started with making something similar to a wireframe model and showing it to our project advisor, <a href="#prof-muthu">Prof. Nelson Muthu</a>. We started working on it and after multiple iterations, we ended up with this.</p>
                    <p>It was a really challenging project for me personally because it exposed me to creating a piece of software from scratch. I got to understand Wagtail and  Django in depth, and also many other small aspects that I would never have come across if I was interning in a huge company, where there is a team for everything. It was also a test of patience for me because I was very rigid at the begining, about what I made is the best. But slowly I started realizing what building for customer means. I had an awesome mentor, <a href="#raghu-bhaiya">Raghuram Krishnaswamy</a> who showed the way throughout. This project is the closest to my heart because I owned its development, fixed the bugs and devoted a good amount of time to it. It has also helped me gain skills which are helpful even now.</p>
                    <p>Before we graduated, we found an awesome guy, <a href="#sudesh">Sudesh</a> and handed it over to him. He has made more optimizations and created Academics section from scratch.</p>
